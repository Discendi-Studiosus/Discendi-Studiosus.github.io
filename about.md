This blog is a written account of my classics-learning journey. With regard to classical languages, I am interested in Greek, Latin, Aramaic, and Biblical Hebrew. With regard to classical philosophy, I am interested in stoicism and particularly enjoy reading Seneca.

### Goals for Summer 2019:

1. Memorize Latin Vocab
2. Learn Biblical Hebrew
3. Learn Aramaic for Gemara
4. Learn Stoicism
