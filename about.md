This blog is a written account of my classics-learning journey. With regard to classical languages, I am interested in Greek, Latin, Babylonian Aramaic, and Biblical Hebrew. With regard to classical philosophy, I am interested in stoicism and particularly enjoy reading Seneca.

### Goals for Summer 2019:

1. Memorize all vocabulary from *Latin for the New Millenium Level 1* and *Latin for the New Millenium Level 2*
2. Learn grammar and vocabulary from *Basics of Biblical Hebrew*
3. Learn grammar from *Grammar for Gemara & Targum Onkelos: An Introduction to Aramaic*
4. Read Seneca
