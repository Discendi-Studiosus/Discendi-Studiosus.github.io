title: My Analysis of Aristotle's Categories
---

**Discussion question unit 1: Do you think Aristotle is correct to claim that his primary substances have a special ontological status because other things are either “in” them or “said of” them? Could they exist without these other things?**

*Can primary substances exist without inherent and universal items?*

It is important to note that these are 2 separate questions, and I have 2 different answers.

*Question 1: Can primary substances exists without inherent items?*

Yes. An object can exist even if it has no properties. Locke called such objects "bare particulars" - featureless substances that serve only to hold other properties. Just like other objects, primary substances can function as bare particulars.

*Question 2: Can primary substances exist without universal items?*

No. The very name 'primary substance' guarantees that any primary substance will be described by at least one universal item - 'primary substance.'

Primary substances do not deserve a special ontological status because particular and universal substances both carry the same influence.

First of all, universal and particular substances are interdependent. Universal substances depend on particular substances in so far as universals are said of particulars. Conversely, particulars depend on universals in so far as every particular must be described by at least one universal (as discussed above).

Furthermore, even as particular substances underly particular inherent items whose existence they don't depend upon, universal substances underly universal inherent items whose existence they don't depend upon.

Since universal and particular substances depend on each other and underly corresponding inherent items which they themselves don't depend on, they deserve an equal ontological status superior to that of the inherent items.
