title: My Structuralist Analysis of the Bacchae
---

**Discussion question unit 8: how would you analyze the Bacchae through a structuralist lens?**

To me it seems that the binary opposition that drives this myth is that between real power and perceived power. The tension between these 2 ideas appears immediately at Dionysus's birth. After Hera discovers Zeus's affair with the now pregnant Semele, she seeks to exact revenge. After Semele's death, it initially seems that Hera has accomplished her goal and wiped out those involved in the affair. However, after Zeus rescues his unborn son and stitches him into his thigh, it becomes brutally obvious who's really in charge. Hera's perceived power over Zeus's engagements doesn't faze Zeus whose position of real authority enables him to act in whatever way he pleases.

Later in the story, this binary opposition plays another crucial role when Pentheus arrests Dionysus. Dionysus allows himself to be easily captured by Penthus, giving him the illusion of power. However, when Pentheus tries to torture/kill him, Dionysus's asserts his real (divine) authority by turning into a bull/shadow and creating an earthquake, not only avoiding Pentheus assaults, but also physically damaging his realm.

Dionysus gives Pentheus a final illusion of power when he elevates him on a tree above the revelers, who then proceed to rip him apart. By raising up Pentheus and then dragging him down to his demise shortly afterwards, Dionysus shows us the fragility of perceived power.
