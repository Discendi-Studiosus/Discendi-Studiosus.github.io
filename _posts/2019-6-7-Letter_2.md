title: Letters from a Stoic - Letter II
---

I have begun to read *Letters from a Stoic*, and I plan to write a short response to the letters I find most interesting. The introduction gave me a general understanding of Stoicism, which I plan to use as my lense into Seneca's reasoning until I come to terms with it on my own.

### Letter II: On Discursiveness in Reading

#### Summary:
In this letter, Seneca warns Lucius not to distribute his energies across too many different pursuits, and more specifically to avoid switching from author to author in his study. One of Seneca's justifications for this claim is the metaphor of food: "tasting one dish after another is a sign of a fussy stomach, and where the foods are dissimilar and diverse in range they lead to contamination of the system, not nutrition." 

#### My Reaction:
In general, I agree that it is important to not spread yourself too thin. However, I am not yet convinced that the same observation extends to the realm of philosophical study. After all, building on Seneca's food metaphor, how is one supposed to determine which foods appeal to him/her without the opportunity to sample them first? How is one to cultivate the "inborn gift of reason" without first exposing oneself to the different styles of reasoning?

Although the introduction warned me of this, I must say that the extremity of Seneca's epigrammatic style, where every third sentence is a motto, still surprised me.
