### My Functionalist Analysis of Fall of Troy in the *Aeneid*

Let us first remind ourselves how Troy fell. Sinon pretended to have deserted the Greeks, and as a Trojan captive, convinced the Trojans to bring the wooden horse into their city in order to supposedly protect against any future Achaean invasion. Of course you know the rest of the story - at night, the Trojans emerge from the horse and open the gates, rendering Troy’s powerful walls completely useless. 

Analysis: Sinon’s deception led to the fall of Troy. Troy was essentially the predecessor of Rome because Aeneas and his followers were all Trojan. Therefore, deception led to fall of the predecessor of Rome. The lesson to contemporary Romans is clear: do not engage in deception or risk destroying Rome and a second fall of Troy. Such a warning would have been especially relevant at the time Vergil was writing the Aeneid, which followed a period of intense civil strife.
