*Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero* by James Romm


Having read some of Seneca's writings, I realized that in order to fully appreciate them I would need to understand the historical context in which they were written. Thus, I purchased and read with great interest this fascinating biography. I decided that I would discuss here one of the more intriguing topics from the book:

### Seneca's Suicide

Although he had prepared a cup of hemlock for the occasion (Socrates killed himself with hemlock), when the day of his demise dawned, he opted to open his veins and kill himself through slow blood loss instead. When we consider that blood loss was the preferred method of suicide of the contemporary Roman elite, Seneca's choice is surprising; throughout his life, Seneca had condemned the Roman aristocracy for their decadent debauched lifestyle. In Letters from a Stoic, which I previously read, his disgust for the elite was made readily apparent. And yet on his deathbed, when making what would essentially be the final decision of his life, Seneca chose to embrace Roman aristocratic traditions. To me, it seems that even in death Seneca was trying to send a message: he despised practically every aspect of the elites' lifestyle, but the one thing that he respected was their willingess to commit suicide in order to escape a life not worth living. By killing himself in a stereotypically Roman way, he gave a final stamp of approval to this practice.
