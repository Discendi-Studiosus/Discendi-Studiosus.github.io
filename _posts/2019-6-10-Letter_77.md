### Letter LXXVII: On taking one's own life

#### Summary:
In letter 77, Seneca claims that suicide is justified, and even honorable, in certain situations. As an example, he relates the story of the young Spartan boy, who, after having been taken prisoner, smashed his head against a wall and cracked open his skull in order to avoid serving as a slave. Seneca furthers that there is little difference between a meaningless life and death. According to Seneca, even the opportunity to continue engaging in worthy activities should not be considered a reason to defer death because there is no fixed number of duties that any individual is responsible for completeing in his/her lifetime.
#### My Reaction:
I disagree with this letter's claim/justifications on several accounts. First of all, even though "there's no fixed number of duties laid down which you're supposed to complete," the more duties you accomplish - that is the more you contribute to society - the better. Therefore, it is every person's responsibility to remain in this world for as long as possible (at the very least) for the purpose of serving the greater good. Second, even if at a particular moment in time, one's life lacks purpose, there is always the potential for improvement; in the case of the young Spartan slave, there was always the potential for freedom, however unlikely it might have been.
