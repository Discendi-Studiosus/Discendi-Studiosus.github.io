### Summary:
I havenâ€™t posted my progress for a while because I wanted to accomplish a lot before my next post. I have certainly succeeded in this endeavor.
### 2. Learn Biblical Hebrew:
I memorized completely the roughly 200 flashcards I made for the first 13 chapters of the textbook, and I of course completed the accompany workbook exercises.
### 5. Learn Greek and Roman Mythology:
I completed the Roman and Greek Mythology course from UPenn and earned a certificate. This course had ~30 hours of lectures, 10 assessments, 10 writing questions, and of course many readings. For the course, I read the following:
* **The Odyssey**
* **Theogony**
* **Homeric Hymns** (longer hymn to Apollo and longer hymn to Demeter)
* **The Oresteia**
* **Oedipus Rex**
* **The Bacchae**
* **The Aeneid** (books 1-6)
* **Metamorphoses** (books 3, 12, 13)

I will be posting my responses to the more interesting writing questions. I also plan to post my takeaways from the various readings I did (beyond the writing questions).

After completing this course, I feel that I am well-equipped to analyze other myths, and I plan to continue my study of classical mythology,
