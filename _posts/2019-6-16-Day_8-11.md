title: Day 8:11 - Progress Report
---

### Summary:

I am not exactly sure how much time I devoted to classics study since my last post, but I certainly accomplished a lot.

### 2. Learn Biblical Hebrew:
I read and made flashcards for almost 100 pages of the textbook (I am currently on page 142 - Chapter 14 *Qal Perfect Weak Verbs*). I now have a total of 181 flashcards. Also, because the rest of the book relies quite heavily on what I have already learned, I will not be reading any more before memorizing all the flashcards so memorizing 181 flashcards is the next item on the bucketlist.

### 4. Learn Stoicism:
I have begun to read a biography on Seneca.

### 5. Learn Greek/Roman Mythology: 
I completed week 2 of the mythology course (3 hours of lectures) and read the first 7 books of the Odyssey. I will try to read through book 12 tomorrow.
