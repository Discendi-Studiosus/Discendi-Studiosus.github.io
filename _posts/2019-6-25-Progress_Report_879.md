### 2. Learn Biblical Hebrew:
I memorized completely the first 24 flashcards I made (essentially the first three chapters of the textbook). I plan to do all the workbook exercises on these topics tomorrow. 

### 5. Learn Greek and Roman Mythology:
I completed the lectures and quiz for week 5 of the mythology course from UPenn. As part of the coursework accompanying the lectures, I read Hesoid's *Theogony*. This is the fourth book I have read this summer (I previously read *The Odyssey*, *Letters from a Stoic*, and *Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero*).
