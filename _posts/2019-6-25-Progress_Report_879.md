### Summary:
I added a new category of exploration to my classics-studying journey. I returned with renewed vigor to my study of Biblical Hebrew.

### 2. Learn Biblical Hebrew:
I memorized completely the first 24 flashcards I made (essentially the first three chapters of the textbook). I plan to do all the workbook exercises on these topics tomorrow. 

### 5. Learn Greek and Roman Mythology:
I completed the lectures and quiz for week 5 of the mythology course from UPenn. As part of the coursework accompanying the lectures, I read Hesoid's *Theogony*. This is the fourth book I have read this summer (I previously read *The Odyssey*, *Letters from a Stoic*, and *Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero*).

### 6. Learn Greek and Roman History (new category!):
I have decided that an important element of studying classics must be uby nderstanding the history of antiquity. I have begun reading *A War Like No Other,* a history of the Peloponnesian War by Victor Davis Hanson.
