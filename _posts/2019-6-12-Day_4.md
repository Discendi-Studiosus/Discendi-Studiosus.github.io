title: Day 7 - Progress Report

### Summary: 
Today, I devoted 4.5 hours to classics study. I spent all that time on Biblical Hebrew. 

### 2. Learn Biblical Hebrew:
I read ~ 35 pages of the textbook and wrote flashcards for all the new grammatical concepts. I now have 65 total flashcards. I am noticing that reading/taking notes on this textbook takes a very long time because itâ€™s so packed with rules that need to be memorized. I know that I was planning on beginning to memorize the flashcards once I had assembled 50 of them, but I have decided that it is better to aim for a more meaningful milestone: 1/4 of the textbook. I hope to meet that milestone within the week!
