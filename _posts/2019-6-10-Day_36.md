title: Day 36 - Progress Report

### Summary:

I am not exactly sure how much time I devoted to classics study this weekend, but here's what I accomplished.

### 4. Learn Stoicism:
I read (cover-to-cover) *Letters from a Stoic* which is a collection of letters written by Seneca to Lucius. The book was â‰ˆ 250 pages. In addition to annotating/taking careful notes, I also published on this blog my reflections on/responses to several of the letters I found most interesting.

### 5. Learn Greek/Roman Mythology: (New category!)
This doesn't really fit in any of my established categories of study, but I have begun an online course on Greek/Roman mythology from UPenn. I completed the material for the first week, which took me about 3 hours.
