## 1. Memorize Latin Vocab
Having just completed Latin II, I have a solid grasp on the majority of grammatical concepts in Latin. However, I have noticed that the limited extent of my vocabulary severely hinders my translation efforts because it forces me to constantly consult the dictionary, which interrupts my thought process. I realize that the next step towards becoming a fluent Latin reader is improving my vocabulary. I will be using __Anki__, a spaced-repetition flashcard program, to memorize two decks of approximately 400 words - one deck holding the vocabulary from *Latin for the New Millenium Level 1* and the other deck holding the vocabulary from *Latin for the New Millenium Level 2*.
## 2. Learn Biblical Hebrew
At the moment, I am familiar with some modern Hebrew vocabulary and the basics of modern Hebrew grammar. However, outside my understanding of modern Hebrew, I have no specific knowledge regarding biblical Hebrew with regard to either its grammar or vocabulary, which both differ vastly from modern Hebrew. This summer, I hope to remedy this by studying the textbook *Basics of Biblical Hebrew Grammar* along with its companion workbook and flashcard set.
## 3. Learn Aramaic for Gemara
I currently have absolutely no knowledge of Aramaic grammar or vocabulary. I will be studying *Grammar for Gemara & Targum Onkelos An Introduction To Aramaic*. The reason for my interest in learning Aramaic is simple: I seek to read the complex discussions of Jewish law in their original language. When a text is translated from its original language into another language, the translator often inserts their own interpretations into the translation, either inadverdently or due to semantical differences between the languages which prevent an exact replication of meaning. This is especially the case for a complicated text like the Gemara. Therefore, by learning the original language, I am removing the barrier and giving myself the opportunity to make my own interpretations.
## 4. Learn Stoicism
I have done some preliminary research on Stoicism and encountered several different classical Roman authors famous for their adherence to it. I will begin by reading *Letters from a Stoic*, which is a collection of various letters written by Seneca.

I am looking forward to a summer full of learning!
