### Letter XLVII: On master and slave

#### Summary:
In letter 49, Seneca condemns Romans' harsh mistreatment of slaves on several grounds. First, he argues that slaves have much in common with their masters: they share the same sky, air, etc. Second, at any point in time, a master might suddenly find himself/herself in the very same position. Finally, Seneca explains that every person is a slave in some form - either to sex, money, ambition, hope or fear; such self-imposed slavery, unlike physical bondage, actually reflects poorly on the character of the person. For these reasons, Seneca recommends that "[you] treat your inferiors in the way in which you would like to be treated by your own superiors."

#### My Reaction:
Although I realize that Seneca's view must have been considered quite progessive in his time, it seems to me that his logic and reasoning for condemning harsh treatment of slaves just as easily applies to the practice of slavery in general. I am of the opinion that in order for a philosophical principle to be valid, it must be universally applicable. In other words, if you are only willing to apply it in specific scenarios in such a way that suits your needs, you should not profess that principle in the first place. Inconsistency is often the hallmark of a self-serving doctrine.
