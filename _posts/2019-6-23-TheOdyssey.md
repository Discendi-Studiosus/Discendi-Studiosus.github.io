title: Takeaways from The Odyssey
---

As part of the course I am taking from UPenn on Greek and Roman mythology, I read the Fagles translation of *The Odyssey* - a beautifully-written and captivating story. In this post, I will discuss some of the interesting ideas I encountered in the book/course.

# Takeaways
## Universal Laws Illustrated by *The Odyssey* 
1. Nostalgia is a powerful force â†’ people always imagine that their past/ancestors were better.
2. If you want to persuade people, you need to know your audience.
3. It is not good to be food
4. Making leadership decisions is often about choosing between 2 bad options
5. When you tell a lie, you should tell a lie that's close to the truth
6. Secrecy creates intimacy
## Toolbox for Analyzing Myths like *The Odyssey* (course has discussed two conceptual frameworks for myth so far)
1. Functionalism: when cultures tell myths, they seek legitimize certain cultural/social norms that they hold dear.
2. Structuralism: at the core of all cultural content lie binary oppositions, and cultures will all place the same pairs of concepts in opposition even if they don't define the concepts in the same way
### Examples of Appying the Toolbox on *The Odyssey*
1. Xenia (functionalism): One of the main cultural innovations that enabled the Greeks to become such successful traders was the concept of xenia or extreme hospitality. It instructed Greeks to welcome strangers and lavish gifts upon them rather than fear or rebuke them. In the context of trade, the assurance of hospitality made merchants more willing to export their goods and created a commerce-friendly environment. *The Odyssey* legitimizes the cultural norm of xenia by describing numerous instances of its correct application and elevating good hosts as rightheous individuals, as well as by describing examples of its abuse/perversion and the negative consequences that arise from such violations.
2. Food/Not Food (structuralism): Many stories in the *The Odyssey* illustrate the dichotomy between what is considered food and what isn't. As discussed earlier, such binary opposites are present in all cultures, but are often defined differently. *The Odyssey* illustrates the function of the opposition in Greek culture specifically. One example of something not considered to be food is the cattle that belongs to the Sun god. When Odysseus's crew violates the rules regarding what is food and what isn't food by gorging themselves on the sacred cattle, they are punished severely (aka killed).
## Ring Composition in *The Odyssey*
Ring composition is a poetic technique that Homer uses to great effect. First, Homer brings up a specific idea/object/concept. Then, he makes a digression describing the story of that idea/object/concept. And then finally, to return the reader to the main storyline, he once again brings up the idea/object/concept. Ring composition essentially has the format ABA.
## Double determination in *The Odyssey*
The Greeks believed that the Gods created the general framework for the passage of time in the human world, but that humans could still  either improve or worsen their condition through their own actions. Furthermore, Greeks believed that heros served as the instruments of Gods' wills. This theory is rendered by the followed quote "These men the doom of the gods has brought low, and their own indecent acts." (452)
## Unexpected Comparisons in *The Odyssey*
In multiple places throughout the book, Homer makes the reader think that he is referring to one character, but then ends up referring to another character. The effect of this technique is to draw a parallel between the two characters. This literary technique appears when Penelope finally embraces Odysseus. The text describes her as a shipwrecked sailor finally returning home (when in reality Odysseus is the shipwrecked sailor). By attaching this label to Penelope, Homer equates her suffering in Odysseus's absence to Odysseus's own suffering in his journey home.
