title: Day 1 - Progress Report
---

### Summary:

Today, I devoted approximately 2.5 hours to language study. I was planning to spend more time on it but alas (it being the first day) I underestimated how long it would take to actualize my other plans. Starting from tomorrow, I will make to dedicate at least 4 hours per day to expanding my classics knowledge. Nevertheless, I was able to make some important first steps.

### 1. Memorizing Latin Vocab:
I flipped through flashcards on anki for LNM2 for 45 minutes and can already feel the spaced repetition starting to works its magic.
### 2. Learning Biblical Hebrew:
I devoted the remainder of the time (1.75 hrs to studying the biblical Hebrew textbook). I read the first 17 pages (2 and a half of chapters) and created flashcards for each grammatical concept discussed - 15 total so far. I have already begun to memorize these flashcards, but I plan to memorize them completely once I reach 50. I completed a couple workbook exercises to reinforce some of these concepts as a preliminary step to memorization. The textbook came with a complementary set of vocabulary flashcards that I will likely begin studying tomorrow.
