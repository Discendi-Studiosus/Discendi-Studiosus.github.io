### Interesting Takeaways from Study of the *Aeneid*:

*Roman myth is not a derivative of Greek myth:*

Before taking the course, I had always viewed Roman myth as a derivative of Greek myth that copied all the core material, but placed an extra emphasis on war and duty. In reality, Greeks and Romans were just borrowing from the same pool of Mediterranean myth materials. If you compare Greek/Roman myths to those of other Mediterranean cultures, you will find an abundance of commonalities.

*Functionalist Reading:*

In an earlier post, I argued that the Aeneid resists a functionalist reading as a raw endorsement of the value of pietas - and that still stands. However, although the Aeneid may not be upholding pietas as a flawless incontrovertible virtue, it does suggest that pietas outweighs all competing desires. The best evidence for this functionalist reading is the story with Dido. As Dido’s guest and a beneficiary of her hospitality, Aeneas participates in the fulfillment of the cultural value of xenia. However, when Mercury reminds Aeneas of his duty, Aeneas abandons Dido in clear violation of xenia. The fact that a god encourages Aeneas to prioritize pietas over xenia simultaneously emphasizes the importance of pietas and diminishes that of xenia. The triumph of pietas over xenia is one of Vergil’s obvious attempts to distinguish the Romans from the Greek, who valued xenia above everything. 


*Vergil seeks to distance Romans from Greeks:*

After defeating the Greeks at Corinth, Romans come to love Greek culture. Despite this admiration, the Romans needed to avoid appearing culturally inferior or risk endangering that cherished patriotic pride. As a result, in describing the Roman identity through the Aeneid, Vergil tries to distance the Romans from the Greeks. The most obvious way that he accomplishes this is by tracing the entire history of Rome back to the Trojans, who were sworn enemies of the Greeks. We already discussed how Vergil establishes the cultural superiority of the Romans by elevating their central virtue, pietas, and lowering that of the Greeks, xenia. Another way Vergil distances the Romans from the Greeks is by portraying lies and deception, which were not only accepted, but prized in Greek culture, in an exceedingly negative light, implying that they are not to be admired.
