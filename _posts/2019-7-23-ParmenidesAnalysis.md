title: Why I Agree That You Can't Think about What Is Not

#### My Analysis of Parmenides's Central Claim

*Discussion Question Unit 2: Do you agree with Parmenides that we can’t think or talk about what is not?*

After extensive personal reflection and online research, I have come to accept Parmenides's conclusion that we can't think or talk about what is not. One who purports to be thinking about something that doesn't exist isn't really thinking at all. Although I accede to Parmenides's conclusion, I do not follow the logic presented by Meyer.
My first attempt to understand Parmenides's conclusion was applying Meyer's logic to a hypothetical example, a nonexistent bank account:

1. I am thinking that there does not exist a bank account in my name
2. Therefore, I am thinking about a bank account in my name
3. Since I am thinking about a bank account in my name, it must exist
4. Therefore, we have reached a contradiction so 1) is an incoherent thought 

I could not help immediately objecting to 3). After all, I could go to the bank and give my name, but nothing would happen no matter how much I thought about there not existing a bank account in my name. 

The crucial flaw in Meyer's reasoning is the premise. According to Parmenides's Principle, if I am thinking about something, it must exist. Therefore, by contrapositive, if something does not exist, I cannot be thinking about it. Since I cannot be thinking about a bank account that doesn't exist, the premise is a mischaracterization of what is actually happening - it claims that I am thinking, but in reality I am not. Thus, neither 2) nor the rest of the logical chain follows from the premise. 
If we are presupposing Parmenides's Principle, the idea that 'is not' thoughts aren't real thoughts follows directly from the contrapositive because we can't 'really' think about things that don't exist. Considering this, I honestly don't understand the purpose of Meyer's logical chain.

So far, I have only discussed my objections to the logical reasoning of Meyer's argument, but now I would like to point out a more general flaw. Meyer concludes that if I am thinking about something that does not exist, that thing must actually exist. This conclusion becomes very problematic once we consider the fact that thinking about something that doesn't exist isn't really thinking: why should we expect the world to generate the opposite outcome of our so-called "thoughts" just because we are behaving in an irrational manner (by thinking about what doesn't exist)?

Once I had finally understood Parmenides's reasoning in condemning 'is not' inquiry, I began to doubt his principle, which was not clearly justified in any of the lectures. Online, I found an alternative, more intuitive (to me) abstraction for demonstrating the self-contradictory nature of 'is not' statements. 

The abstraction presupposes 2 assumptions:

<ol>
<li>If a statement is true/false, it is meaningful - i.e. evaluable for truth/falsity</li>
<li>If a statement is meaningful, it is about something</li>
</ol>

Consider any statement "X does not exist." If the statement is true, then it is about nothing. By contrapositive of assumption 2, if a statement is about nothing (i.e., not about something), it is not meaningful (i.e., not evaluable for truth/falsity). By contrapositive of assumption 1, if a statement is not meaningful, it is not true/false. Therefore, if the statement is true, it can neither be true or false. We have arrived at the conclusion that statements of the form "X does not exist" cannot be true.

Finally, we return to the bank account example, which motivated this entire response. Recall that my initial objection to Meyer's logic was that I could simply call the bank, and they would confirm that no bank account existed in my name, which directly contradicted 3), which said that the bank account must exist if I was thinking about it. Armed with this new abstraction, I can respond easily. Even if the bank says that the statement, "the bank account in my name does not exist," is true, it's not because you cannot make a true statement about nothing.

Because statements of the form "X does not exist" cannot be true (and are self-undermining), Parmenides excluded them from the sphere of scientific inquiry and relegated them to that of "mortal opinion."
