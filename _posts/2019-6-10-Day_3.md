title: Day 3 - Progress Report
---

### Summary:

Today, I once again devoted approximately 2.5 hours to language study. As I wrote in yesterday's entry, I was planning on spending more time, but it didn't work out today. 

### 1. Memorizing Latin Vocab:
According to the Anki software, I spent 45 minutes and viewed 299 flashcards.
### 2. Learning Biblical Hebrew:
I read through chapter 4 on the Basics of Biblical Hebrew Textbook, and I create 13 flashcards for the grammar material in chapter 3 and the first half of chapter 4 (I have not finished taking notes on chapter 4 because I read through the text first in order to gain a solid understanding of the material before starting flashcards).

*Letters form a Stoic* did indeed arrive today. I will begin reading it tomorrow.
