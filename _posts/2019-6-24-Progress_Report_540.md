title: Progress Report

**Note: I have decided that I will no longer track days/hours.**

### Summary:
Much has been accomplished in the realm of mythology/history since the last report - not so much in Biblical Hebrew. I will be dedicating more time from now on to that pursuit.

### 4. Learn Stoicism:
I read a biography on Seneca and wrote a post about my takeaways. (*Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero* by James Romm)
### 5. Learn Greek and Roman Mythology:
I watched (and tooks notes on) the lectures from weeks 3 and 4 (6 hours total). I also read the entirety of *The Odyssey* (the Fagles translation) which took a very long time, but it was worth it. I also wrote a post on my takeaways from *The Odyssey.*
