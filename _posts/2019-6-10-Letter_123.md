### Letter CXXIII: On the conflict between pleasure and virtue

#### Summary:
In letter 123, Seneca emphasizes the importance of expunging your appetite for pleasure and your fear of pain/exertion. He also warns Lucuius to disregard those who claim that the shortness of life justifies hedonism, as well as to avoid the unreasonable/ostentatious conventions of many in the Roman elite. 
#### My Reaction:
In the letter, Seneca takes advantage of a very interesting metaphor. When ascending a mountain, you lean forward; when descending a mountain you lean backward. Similarly, you should lean toward exertion/pain and lean backward from pleasure. If you extend the metaphor, it is even more powerful: the reason that you lean backwards when descending a mountain is so that you can maintain control of your own pace and minimize the risk of tripping and plummeting to the bottom. Similarly, you must maintain control over your pleasure-seeking impulses or risk plunging into a life of vice and evil.
