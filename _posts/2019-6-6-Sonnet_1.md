title: Vaulting Ambition - A Sonnet
---

I know that poetry is a bit out of the scope of this blog, but I decided to try my hand at a sonnet and thought that I would showcase here the product of my musings. I wrote a short intro to help ease you into the verse.

### *Intro*

*A fighting match between two dogs, a Terrier and a Rottweiler, is taking place in a dog fighting ring. The muscular, yet inexperienced Terrier, who is superior in stature to the haggard Rottweiler, anticipates a swift victory. When his prediction proves incorrect, will the Terrier contain his lust and avoid a reckless blunder? Or will he succumb to his impulses and fall victim to his seemingly inferior opponent? Can better instincts possibly prevail over vaulting ambition?*

### *Vaulting Ambition - A Sonnet*

*Imposing build, yet oozing ignorance,*  
*The terrier prancés behind the scratch.*  
*For victory keen without hindrance,*  
*Over gaunt still Rott opposite in match.* 

*Alas, ambition’s triumph was not swift.*  
*With every closer step, a brisk retreat.*  
*Yet, the Rott’s sudden lunges shrink the rift,*  
*Just moments forth restored in harsh deceit.* 

*Each repetition longer he remained,*  
*Yet never long enough for crucial leap.*  
*Withstands ambition’s torture greatly pained,*  
*Can shrewd instincts defend the cogent steep?*  

*With frantic pounce succumbs to reckless lust,*  
*Once noble form lies mangled in the dust.*
